Blackjack Server
================

An old assignment written in C where I had to create a Blackjack server which accepted a client.
Once the client had been authenticated it creates a dealer and deals cards until the client stands.
The dealer then attempts to beat the client and returns the result of the game back to the client.

Note that the client itself was not actually implemented as part of the assignment, we were only
meant to match the interface.
